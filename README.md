# HMoTP
High-speed milling of thin-walled parts (HMoTP) dataset 2023 released by Prof. Qinghua Song's Lab from Shandong University.
## Paper
This is a dataset for our submitted paper 'Toward digital twins for high-performance manufacturing: Tool wear monitoring in high-speed milling of thin-walled parts using domain knowledge'
## Dataset structure
Data of Each cutting in the dataset is stored as an independent CSV file. 
The cutting data of the three tools are stored in folders named CuttingsignalsT01/CuttingsignalsT02/CuttingsignalsT03 respectively. 
Each cutting tool has 100 sets of cutting data. Taking the T1 tool as an example, its cutting data is saved in 100 CSV files named T01_001.CSV to T01_100.CSV.
Each CSV file of cutting data contains data for 7 channels: Fx, Fy, Fz, Mz, Ax, Ay, and Az.
Each cutting data corresponds to a tool wear value, and the wear values of all tools are saved in files named ToolWeaT01.csv/ToolWeaT02.csv/ToolWeaT03.csv.
